## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
The code was tested with `python=3.6.9`, as well as `pytorch=1.10.0+cu111` and `torchvision=0.11.2+cu111`. 

Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. Installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support is strongly recommended.

1. Clone the repository locally:

```
 git clone https://github.com/jmwang0117/AGRNav.git
```
2. We recommend using **Docker** to run the project, which can reduce the burden of configuring the environment, you can find the Dockerfile in our project, and then execute the following command:
```
 docker build . -t skywalker_robot -f Dockerfile
```
3. After the compilation is complete, use our **one-click startup script** in the same directory:
```
 bash create_container.sh
```


4. Next enter the container and use git clone our project
```
 docker exec -it robot bash
```

5. Re-clone the repository locally

```
 git clone https://github.com/jmwang0117/AGRNav.git
```

6. Since need to temporarily save the point cloud, please check the path in the following file:
```
/root/AGRNav/src/perception/launch/inference.launch

/root/AGRNav/src/perception/SCONet/network/data/SemanticKITTI.py

/root/AGRNav/src/perception/script/pointcloud_listener.py
```

7. SCONet pre-trained model is in the folder below:
```
/root/AGRNav/src/perception/SCONet/network/weights
```
8. If you want to use our 3D AGR model, please download the AGR model to the folder below:
```
/root/AGRNav/src/uav_simulator/Utils/odom_visualization/meshes
```

And modify the code on line 503 in the following file to AGR.dae
```
/root/AGRNav/src/uav_simulator/Utils/odom_visualization/src/odom_visualization.cpp
```

9. Run the following commands 
```
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
sh src/run.sh
```

You've begun this project successfully; **enjoy yourself!**
